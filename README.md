# docker-compose network
## Hands on docker-compose. Simple client-Server app. 
## Redis is being ran on a different container, and the nodejs app talks to it through docker network.
### To run the app:
  1. Make sure you have docker & docker-compose installed
  2. Get inside docker-compose-network directory and run "docker-compose up"
  3. Enter http://localhost:8080/ in your own machine, and see the result.
